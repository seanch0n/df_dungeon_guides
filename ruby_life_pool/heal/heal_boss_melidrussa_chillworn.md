This is a lot of un-interruptable magic damage fight.

Mechanics
---------
- [hailbombs] cast - stack before the cast finishes, drops puddle on ground
    - does large aoe damage when cast goes off
    - puddles apply [frozen] stacking debuff. At 8 stacks you freeze for 6 seconds
- [chillstorm] cast - run this far away from the group
    - pulls all players into it doing ticking damage, then explodes for higher damage
    - explosion pushes you backwards
- [awaken whelps] cast - summons whelps from the opposite side of the room
    - happens at 70 and 40 percent health
    - have the group stack, have big aoe threat ready
    - [cold claws] cast - interrupt. Stacking debuff from whelps.
        - if it gets to 8 stacks, tank gets frozen for 6 seconds
- [frost overload] cast - 15 seconds. Damage absorb off her and interrupt or wipe
    - happens after [awaken whelps] cast.
