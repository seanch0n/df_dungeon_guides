=======
This boss has mulitple waves of adds, alternating easy/hard/easy.

Before the boss
---------------
- make sure you kill the roaming skitterflies.
- to activate boss, kill all groups of "vile lashers" in the room.

Mechanics
---------
- [barkbreaker] cast - use defensive, leaves a 1 minute bleed.
- [germinate] cast - creates brown swirlies under players feet that spawn adds.
    - stack on tank and walk in circle around the boss to keep adds grouped up.
- [branch out] cast - summons an <ancient branch> add, casts a 1 minute stacking debuff on party.
    - focus this add.
    - Kick adds [healing touch] cast.
    - the longer the add is alive, the more stacks the group gets
    - once add dies, stand in green circle to drop [barkbreaker] debuff
- [burst forth] cast - large aoe to group, use defensives.
    - This happens when boss is at 100% energy (2nd wave of adds)
